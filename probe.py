"""Protocol probe: reports every byte that changes on the network, live.

Use it to find out whether a control on the player travels over Pro DJ Link.
Start it, wait a few seconds while it learns the idle state, and from then on it
prints each byte that changes, naming the field it belongs to.

    python probe.py                 watch everything
    python probe.py --all           do not discard the fields that move on their own

To check whether the channel faders are transmitted: start it, wait for the
"ready" notice, and move the faders. If nothing shows up, that data does not
travel over the network.
